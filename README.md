# FCHelper

FCHelper is an EDI desktop application which was created for an insurance File Consultant. Among other things, its primary use is to keep track of new file feed implementations for HSA and FSA setups. It allows the user to see at glance how much work has been done on the implementation, what the current status is, who the main people are involved, what files are involved and to quickly send talored emails to the listed contacts for each implementation. The app allows the user to add, duplicate, delete, archive, unarchive any implementation as well as the ability to pull information from a Word document that is dropped onto the implementation list. It autopulls the information from the document and inserts it into the Implementation list.

The secondary use for FCHelper is file finding and EDI file processing, which uses a specific file structure. The user can drag/drop any recieved file and see the other related input/output files as well as HSA/FSA file error reports generated by an ETL process. There are many other EDI file processing tasks that FCHelper is capable of which makes it a one stop shop for a File Consultant.

***PLEASE NOTE*** 
This program requires an ETL specific file structure to do many of its EDI functions and does not auto install the ETL file structure it is designed for. Also, some of the class files are missing from this list because they contain confidential information.
