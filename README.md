# FCHelper

FCHelper is an EDI desktop application which was created for an insurance File Consultant. Among other things, its primary use is to keep track of new file feed implementations for HSA and FSA setups.
It allows the user to see at glance how much work has been done on the implementation, what the current status is, who the main people are involved, what files are involved.
Implementation wise, the app allows the user to add, duplicate, delete, archive, unarchive any implementation. The secondary use for FCHelper is file finding. Using a specific
file structure, the user can drag/drop any recieved file and see the other related input/output files as well as error report files generated by an ETL process. There are many other EDI file processing tasks that this program can do which makes it a one stop shop for a File Consultant.
